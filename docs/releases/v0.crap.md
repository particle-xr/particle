# v0.crap

This release will be the first public release. It will be released to users as a limited time beta. The functionality in this release will be as follows:

- A single, [[genesis|persistent]] world
- Users should be able to interact with objects (e.g. pick a flower, hold it in their hand and inspect it)
- Teleportation will be free
- HUD will be static, not [[hud|customizable]]
- No PvP, PvE
- No custom worlds, e.g. [[hosting|chatrooms]]
- *Maybe* we can sneak in the [[sandbox|sandbox]]?

### Persistence

The *world* will be [[genesis|persistent]] however user state will not. The implication of user state *not* persistenting is that their will be no character progression, inventory, etc.

### Interaction

There will be limited interaction within the world, limited to:
- holding objects
- inspecting objects
- ???

## Milestones

How can we break this down? Let's try thinking backwards:

We want a world. Ok, so we need a minimal [[engine]] which supports the protocol and rendering components necessary to realize a world.
This implies we have two requirements:
1. We need to figure out the way we model worlds.
2. We need to figure out the actual rendering of these models.
