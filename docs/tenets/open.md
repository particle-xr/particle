title: Totally and completely open
---

First things first. Open source. That's an easy one.

But what we _really_ mean by "totally and completely open" is that we want **everything** to be customizable, determined by the players.
And we mean "everything" literally. From the UI, HUD and keybinds all the way to the [[semantics]] of the game.

Particle shouldn't impose **any** restrictions or constraints on its players. They should be free to do whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want. That is the ultimate goal.
