title: Time
---

The idea here will be to run simulations on different time scales simultaneously. Simulations on the scale of an hour, day, week, year will all play out simulatenously.

In effect, "time" will be a layered concept. Larger scale simulations will depend on the result of smaller scale simulations. For example, a "big" event which plays out over the course of a year might be made up many smaller scale events that play out over the course of a few days or weeks. It may even be the case that we _don't know_ what smaller scale events might arise, perhaps due to [[emergence|emergent complexity]].
