## Company

### Company name

Particle XR

### Company URL

https://willruggiano.github.io/particle

### Demo?

No.

### What does your company do?

Particle will be a real-time interactive simulation engine. Unity, Unreal Engine, etc... on steroids, and optimized for **massive** scale.

### What is your company going to make?

OASIS from Ready Player One.

Particle will borrow ideas from real-time streaming protocols and apply them to video game design on a massive scale (think: universe, not world). Worlds will be modelled scientifically and "growth" (and decay) will be organic and persistent; the universe will be constantly changing with time; no two in-world experiences will be the same. The universe will have its own economy (that's how we'll make money). The game itself will be free (see: fortnite, warzone, etc) but users will pay for real estate, items (think: NFTs, but with utility), transportation (teleportation fees), etc. Worlds will have designations which allow PvE, PvP. So a creator could build an educational world wherein PvP is disallowed; imagine a virtual representation of the [Internet Archive][internet-archive]. It's cliche, but the possibilities really are endless. Users can make _real_ money performing virtual jobs, e.g. building spaceships for other users.

## Progress

### How far along are you?

I am currently a salaried employee at AWS, so I haven't had a lot of time to dedicate to getting this going. I am planning to quit to spend more time figuring this idea out. There's _a lot_ to consider.

### How long have you been working on this?

Basically only before and after work for a few months. No real coding just yet. Just ideating and high level design.

## Idea

### Why did you pick this idea?

Who wouldn't want to build the OASIS from RP1? I think it can go even further. People love video games; it's a huge market. There isn't really anything like this out there just yet, but the metaverse is a brand new thing. I've never built a video game before. I've dabbled in various tutorials for Unreal, Unity and some open-source alternatives and, personally, I feel like they all suck. They take a very... brute force approach to world design. I don't want to design every little detail of my world in some clunky IDE. I want the details to design themselves. I want to build my world while I'm walking (virtually) through it. I want to create mountains by pinching the ground and pulling it up. I want the _players_ to have a say in what the world looks like!

### What do you understand that others don't?

Particle is a crazy idea. It's incomprehensibly massive. So how do you tackle it? The key, which most people don't understand, is understanding the shape of the problem. What _is_ the problem? How do you build a persistent, organically evolving _universe_? The solution? Let the universe design itself.

The job I am currently doing is exactly that: creating a solution by letting the shape of the problem dictate the design. My company (AWS) literally said we were crazy, that it wouldn't work. And now we're the backbone of one of its more profitable services, and we're doing it in a way that no one else in the industry ever even dreamed of (because if they did they'd think they were crazy).

### How will you make money?

The Particle universe will have its own economy. Taxes, real estate, items, teleportation fees. Imagine: years from now the most valuable crypto will be one that is only useful in a video game :laughing:.
