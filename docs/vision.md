# Vision

**Particle is a real-time interactive simulation protocol and engine.**

We are going to try to borrow some ideas from real-time streaming protocols and apply them to video game design on a massive scale. Particle will be an entirely new perspective on _how_ to design worlds. Forget about _objects_ and _scenes_; focus on the lowest levels of existence. On science, on elements. Let the world evolve organically; _let the world build itself_.

## Premise

Model worlds scientifically, at the atomic level. In doing so, growth, interaction, et al will be unnecessary as objects (made up of elements; taking a certain shape) will organically derive their "interfaces" from their elemental makeup. For example, plants will not require code to make them grow; the interaction (or lack thereof) of a plant with water and light will inherently result in growth (or decay) as this will be a fundamental trait of the plant, defined by its elemental makeup.
