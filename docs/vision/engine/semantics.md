title: Dynamic Semantics
---

Consider how traditional video games work these days. You download the game and with it come pre-defined semantics. Wouldn't it be cool if those semantics could change _dynamically_?!
Even cooler, what if the semantics were determined not by the developers, but rather by the users.

Here's an example;
What do we do with a player's items when they die?
In something like Warzone, when you die you drop everything which can then be looted by other players.
But then there's tarkov. If you die, you lose all of your items. But if you **win** you get to keep all of your items.
What if our semantics were both, and decided by the players. How? Think of it like an election. At some specific cadence, the semantics of the game (among... anything?) go up for review. Every player has the opportunity to vote on what they want the semantics to be. So maybe the player base decides that they prefer keeping their items even when they die... fine, so be it. After the conclusion of voting, the results of the vote propagate through the system and are automatically (dynamically) applied. So you might be go into a fight under the presumption that if you die, you keep your items. The vote ends mid fight and the universe decides that when you die you should drop your items. Boom, semantics changed. You die. You drop all of your items. Oof!

Clearly there will be cases where certain semantics **must** be set in stone. The idea behind dynamic semantics and, more importantly, player defined semantics is super intriguing. I think this would be something that would set us apart right from the get go. And, of course, is in line with our [[open|principal tenet]]
