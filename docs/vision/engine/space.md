title: Particle Space
---
Can we foresee a new "coordinate system" emerging? One in which we are not working in, e.g., Euclidean space but in some alternate spacial mechanism. Consider the idea that, in the particle universe, *everything* is modelled at the lowest "particle level". Does this mean that, simply by choosing such an architecture, we can form "space" based on particle arrangement?
