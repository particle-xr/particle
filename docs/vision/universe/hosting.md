title: Hosting your own Simulation
---
Users should be able to host their own simulation. These self-hosted simulations will simply be endpoints within the world (e.g. socket addresses) to which other users, assuming sufficient permissions, can connect to.

An example of a self-hosted simulation would be a chatroom wherein the owner has created a room where users can coexist and interact.

Chatrooms are a good usecase for [[genesis|static]] simulations
