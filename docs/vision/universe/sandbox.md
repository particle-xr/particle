title: Sandbox
---
The Sandbox will be an in-game, [[genesis|static]] simulation wherein users can play around with creating their own simulations. It will allow users to create a simulation, explore their simulation (localhost only), and save/export [[genesis|state files]].

I imagine the Sandbox to take on similar semantics to currently existing AR/XR applications wherein you can actually interact with your creations and shape them as you wish (e.g. you could grab the peak of a mountain and drag it upwards to make the mountain taller).

Think of the Sandbox as Particle's implementation of Unity and Unreal's dedicated IDEs.
