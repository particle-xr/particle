title: In-world economics, using the Ethereum blockchain
---
First of all, *free to play*. No questions asked.

But, seeing as how this will be a realistic world (or maybe not), there will need to be an in-game currency. So here's the idea. Create a in-game crypto currency. [Can it be hosted *on* the Ethereum blockchain?] Worldlings will use it to e.g. pay transportation/teleportation fees, buy and sell things (weapons, vehicles, property, NFTs!), get paid for performing jobs, earn it through quests, etc.

Though, I like the idea of "not being able to pay money to get better <insert-whatever-here>"; no underdogs allowed. How could we accomplish that? We could just disallow it: there is no way to swap real currency for credits. But it would *also* be cool to create an in-game crypto which could then be traded on real-world crypto markets. Imagine: 10 years from now the most popular crypto currency is one you can only use in a game :laughing:.

I mentioned NFTs. I can't believe they haven't made themselves into videogames yet! Imagine how cool *that* would be. Real-world vendors could sell virtual items in the form of NFTs, e.g. Nike could sell special sneakers, authors could sell "virtual first editions", and because the whole in-world economy is based on some blockchain (which also exists in the real-world, just like other cryptos) these in-world items essentially become NFTs; they could be bought, sold and traded in the real-world *just* like normal NFTs. **Except**, *except*, except they aren't just any old NFT. In-world they actually have utility! (e.g. a badass sword)
